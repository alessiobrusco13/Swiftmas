# 🎅 Swiftmas 🎄

Swiftmas is your ultimate companion to celebrate the holiday season! Built with Swift and SwiftUI, this Christmas app brings festive features to keep you in the holiday spirit.

This project was born out of a need to learn and experiment with **Widgets**, **Live Activities** (⚠️WIP⚠️), and **Package-Based App Architecture**. Christmas felt like the perfect theme to make the learning process enjoyable and festive.

## ✨ Features

- **Christmas Countdown**: Know exactly how many days, hours, minutes and *even seconds* are left until Christmas!
- **Santa Tracker**: Find out how far Santa is from your location.
- **Gift To-Do List**: Stay organized with a checklist for all your holiday presents.
- **Widgets and Live Activities**: Keep holiday cheer right on your home screen with customizable widgets and live activity updates for christmas tasks.
